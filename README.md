Draw thousands of random points above Madrid on Google Maps


I need to paint 1M points on a map (with cluster points if necessary).
Google Maps API is unable to pintarm√°s 100K points because the browser is locked (depending on hardware)

markerclusterer.js does not solve this problem because it creates clusters once the markers are rendered on the map.

Solution: use cartoDB
